### Project Description
An outrageously mischievous task manager that not only lets you add, edit, pin, and delete tasks but also tempts you with built-in mini-games like Tic Tac Toe and a typing speed test‚Äîperfect for glorious procrastination.
Fueled by random ‚Äúevil‚Äù task suggestions and dripping with dark humor, it transforms productivity into a wickedly entertaining challenge you‚Äôll almost enjoy losing.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It solves the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of being too productive by replacing dull to-do lists with one that mocks you, tempts you with games, and offers ‚Äúevil‚Äù suggestions‚Äîwhile pretending to help

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By combining a snarky task manager with built-in distractions‚Äî villain-style themes, random ‚Äúevil‚Äù task suggestions, and procrastination-fueling mini-games‚Äîall wrapped in the guise of productivity.
