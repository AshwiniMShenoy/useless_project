# DO - TO : Productivity is just a myht invented by people with energy.  🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: MindMesh


### Team Members
- Team Lead: ASHWINI M SHENOY - SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY

### Project Description
An outrageously mischievous task manager that not only lets you add, edit, pin, and delete tasks but also tempts you with built-in mini-games like Tic Tac Toe and a typing speed test—perfect for glorious procrastination.
Fueled by random “evil” task suggestions and dripping with dark humor, it transforms productivity into a wickedly entertaining challenge you’ll almost enjoy losing.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It solves the “problem” of being too productive by replacing dull to-do lists with one that mocks you, tempts you with games, and offers “evil” suggestions—while pretending to help

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By combining a snarky task manager with built-in distractions— villain-style themes, random “evil” task suggestions, and procrastination-fueling mini-games—all wrapped in the guise of productivity.
